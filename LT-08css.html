    <h2>Overflow Handling Demonstration</h2>

    
    <div class="box" id="visibleBox">
        <h3>overflow: visible</h3>
        This is a sample paragraph used to demonstrate how the overflow property works in CSS. 
        The text inside this box is longer than the box itself, so you can see how the content 
        behaves when it does not fit inside the fixed-size area. Depending on the overflow setting, 
        the extra text may appear outside the box.
    </div>

   
    <div class="box" id="hiddenBox">
        <h3>overflow: hidden</h3>
        This paragraph is intentionally long so that it does not fit inside the container. 
        When overflow is set to “hidden,” the extra text is simply clipped and cannot be seen 
        unless you change the CSS property. This helps show how hidden overflow works.
    </div>

   
    <div class="box" id="scrollBox">
        <h3>overflow: scroll</h3>
        This text explains how scroll overflow works. Because the content is longer than the box, 
        scrollbars will appear even if you do not need them. This lets you read the extra text by 
        scrolling within the box, showing a clear example of scroll behavior.
    </div>

   
    <div class="box" id="autoBox">
        <h3>overflow: auto</h3>
        In this box, the overflow property is set to “auto.” This means scrollbars will appear only 
        when they are needed. If the content fits inside the box, no scrollbar is shown. If the 
        content overflows, a scrollbar appears automatically to allow scrolling.
